### Stacked Balls - 3D (triangle base)

**Background** 

I have stacked some cannon balls in a triangle-based pyramid.

Like this,

**Kata Task**  

Given the number of `layers` of my stack, what is the total height?

Return the height as multiple of the ball diameter.

**Example**  

The image above shows a stack of 3 layers.

**Notes**
* `layers` >= 0
* approximate answers (within 0.001) are good enough
