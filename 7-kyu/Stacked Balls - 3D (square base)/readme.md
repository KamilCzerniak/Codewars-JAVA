### Stacked Balls - 3D (square base)

**Background**  

I have stacked some cannon balls in a square pyramid.

Like this,

**Kata Task**  

Given the number of `layers` of my stack, what is the total height?

Return the height as multiple of the ball diameter.

**Example** 
The image above shows a stack of 4 layers.

Notes
* `layers` >= 0
* approximate answers (within 0.001) are good enough
