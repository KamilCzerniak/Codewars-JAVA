### The First Non Repeated Character In A String

You need to write a function, that returns the first non-repeated character in the given string.

For example for string `"test"` function should return `'e'`.
For string `"teeter"` function should return `'r'`.

If a string contains all unique characters, then return just the first character of the string.
Example: for input `"trend"` function should return `'t'`

You can assume, that the input string has always non-zero length.
