### 80's Kids #3: Punky Brewster's Socks

Punky loves wearing different colored socks, but Henry can't stand it.

Given an array of different colored socks, return a pair depending on who was picking them out.

**Example:**
```java
getSocks('Punky', ['red','blue','blue','green']) -> ['red', 'blue']  
```
```java
getSocks('Punky', ['red','blue','blue','green']) -> ['red', 'blue']  
```
```java
getsocks('Punky', ['red','blue','blue','green']) -> ['red', 'blue']  
```
```java
getsocks('Punky', ['red','blue','blue','green']) -> ['red', 'blue']  
```
```java
getSocks("Punky", ["red","blue","blue","green"]) -> ["red", "blue"]
```
Note that Punky can have any two colored socks, in any order, as long as they are different and both exist. Henry always picks a matching pair.

If there is no possible combination of socks, return an empty array.
