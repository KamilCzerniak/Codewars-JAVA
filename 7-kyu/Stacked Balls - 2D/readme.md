### Stacked Balls - 2D

**Background**  

I have stacked some pool balls in a triangle.

Like this,

**Kata Task**  

Given the number of `layers` of my stack, what is the total height?

Return the height as multiple of the ball diameter.

**Example**  

The image above shows a stack of 5 layers.

**Notes**  
* `layers` >= 0  
* approximate answers (within 0.001) are good enough
