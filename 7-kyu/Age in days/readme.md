### Age in days

Did you ever want to know how many days you are old? Write a function ageInDays which returns your age in days.

For example if today is 30 November 2015 then
```java
ageInDays(2015, 11, 1) returns "You are 29 days old"
```
The birthday is entered as integers in the following order
```java
ageInDays(year, month, day)  
```
For example if you are born 27 November 2007 then call ageInDays(2007, 11, 27).

Your birthday is expected to be in the past.
