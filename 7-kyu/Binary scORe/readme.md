### Binary scORe

Objective

Given a number `n` we will define it's scORe to be `0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | ... | n`, where `|` is the [bitwise OR operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR).

Write a function that takes `n` and finds it's scORe.

**Examples** | n | scORe n |---------|--------
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 49 | 63

| 1000000 | 1048575
