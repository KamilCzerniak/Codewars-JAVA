### FIXME: Let's split this joint

The code provided is supposed return an array of items that were separated in the `joint` string by `.`

But it's not working properly.

**Notes** 
* A zero length input `joint` string should yield an empty output array  
* Empty items are preserved  

**Task**  

Fix the bug so we can all go home early.
