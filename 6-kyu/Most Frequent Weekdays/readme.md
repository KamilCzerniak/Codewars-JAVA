### Most Frequent Weekdays

What is your favourite day of the week? Check if it's the most frequent day of the week in the year.

You are given a year as integer (e. g. 2001). You should return the most frequent day(s) of the week in that year. The result has to be a list of days sorted by the order of days in week (e. g. `['Monday', 'Tuesday']`). Week starts with Monday.

Input: Year as an int.

Output: The list of most frequent days sorted by the order of days in week (from Monday to Sunday).

Preconditions: Year is between 1 and 9999. Week starts with Monday. Calendar is Gregorian.

**Example:**
```java
Kata.mostFrequentDays(2427) => {"Friday"}
Kata.mostFrequentDays(2185) => {"Saturday"}
Kata.mostFrequentDays(2860) => {"Thursday", "Friday"}
```
In Ruby years will start from 1593.
