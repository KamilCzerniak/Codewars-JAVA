### Points in the circle

You have the `radius` of a circle with the center in point `(0,0)`.

Write a function that calculates the number of points in the circle where `(x,y)` - the cartesian coordinates of the points - are `integers`.

Example: for `radius = 2` the result should be `13`.

`0 <= radius <= 1000`
